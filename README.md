# RedBlack Tree - Algorithm

##Introduction 
Red black tree was introduced by Rudolf Bayer as “Symmetric Binary-Tree” in his 1972 paper. 
Later in 1978, Leonidas J.Guibas and Robert Sedgewick added the red and black property and gave the tree its name.  
Red-Black trees are ordered binary trees where each node uses a color attribute – RED and BLACK.
These colors are just to keep the tree balanced.
No leaf is more than twice as far from the root as any other.
It’s a self-balancing tree that automatically keeps the tree’s height as short as possible for better performance.
##Properties
The root is black.
If a node is red, both children are black.
All paths from a node to its leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
Sentinel nodes contain NIL or NULL values, and are used to indicate the end of a subtree. Their color is always black. 
The average and worst-case of insert, delete, and search time is O(log n).
When data is constantly changing, red-black trees can perform faster than arrays and linked lists.
